What is needed: 
- boards 
    array, and if there is a mine the value stored should be 1 
    so when checking if there is a mine, array = 1 = mine 
- moves
- minesLocations  
- checkMines() --> check rather player input has mine  
- validMove() --> check rather the corrdinate inputed is within the board
- mineCount() --> number of mines in it's surroundings (checking all 8 directions)
    count number of 1 around the location 
- playUntil() --> game ends when player select corrdinate of mine or when all mines are selected 
- when game starts mine should be placed in random locations 
- levels() --> selection of level Beginner, Intermediate or Advanced (board size is set based on the level of difficulty and so is number of mines)
    random thought: what if we can do grind size as one and the level of difficulty for each based on the number of mines there are 
                    - so player would chose the grind size and then if they chose advanced there would be more mines and if they chose beginner 
                      there's less 

how to put down flags? 

playMineSweeper() --> where player chose the level
Level() --> when a level is chosen by the player differnet map show up
